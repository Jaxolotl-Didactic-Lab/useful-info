# useful-info

A series of documents in MD format to aid the autodidacts finding relevant resources.

Initially this repository was meant to host links to different readings without any other notation, but lately I started adding richer and more detailed information to better explain and study this concepts.

Everything is perfectible through collaboration and the goal for this ( and the foundation of my philosophy ) is to share with others what was shared with me and add, when possible, a little of my learning process that might help others to learn.

Corrections, questions and explanations are absolutely welcome!!! don't hesitate to contact me if you want to collaborate.

Yours
Jax
